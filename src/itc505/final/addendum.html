  <h1>Addendum - Lights Out Game</h1>
  
  <!-- Process -->
  <p>
    <strong>Process:</strong><br>
    1. Created HTML structure for the game board.<br>
    2. Styled the board and squares using CSS for a clean layout.<br>
    3. Implemented JavaScript logic for toggling square colors and checking win condition.<br>
    4. Set up an initial solvable board configuration using random toggling.<br>
  </p>
  
  <!-- Creative Choices -->
  <p>
    <strong>Creative Choices:</strong><br>
    - Utilized CSS grid layout for organizing the game board.<br>
    - Used CSS classes for toggling square states to simplify color manipulation.<br>
    - Ensured the random initial board configuration remained solvable by implementing toggle patterns.<br>
  </p>
  
  <!-- Challenges Faced -->
  <p>
    <strong>Challenges Faced:</strong><br>
    - Generating a random solvable board configuration while ensuring the toggle pattern.<br>
    - Efficiently handling square click events and checking for a win condition.<br>
    - Providing clear visual feedback on square clicks for adjacent squares.<br>
  </p>
  
 <p>
    <strong>Insights Gained:</strong><br>
    - Enhanced understanding of grid-based layouts and flexbox in CSS.<br>
    - Strengthened problem-solving skills through JavaScript logic implementation.<br>
    - Learned techniques for managing game state and user interactions.<br>
    - Explored methods to optimize code for improved performance.<br>
