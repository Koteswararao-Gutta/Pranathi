  <h1>Addendum - Lights Out Game</h1>
  
  <!-- Process -->
  <p>
    <strong>Process:</strong><br>
    1. Created HTML structure for the game board.<br>
    2. Styled the board and squares using CSS for a clean layout.<br>
    3. Implemented JavaScript logic for toggling square colors and checking win condition.<br>
    4. Set up an initial solvable board configuration using random toggling.<br>
  </p>
  
  <!-- Creative Choices -->
  <p>
    <strong>Creative Choices:</strong><br>
    - Utilized CSS grid layout for organizing the game board.<br>
    - Used CSS classes for toggling square states to simplify color manipulation.<br>
    - Ensured the random initial board configuration remained solvable by implementing toggle patterns.<br>
  </p>
  
  <!-- Challenges Faced -->
  <p>
    <strong>Challenges Faced:</strong><br>
    - Generating a random solvable board configuration while ensuring the toggle pattern.<br>
    - Efficiently handling square click events and checking for a win condition.<br>
    - Providing clear visual feedback on square clicks for adjacent squares.<br>
  </p>
  
 <p>
    <strong>Insights Gained:</strong><br>
    - Enhanced understanding of grid-based layouts and flexbox in CSS.<br>
    - Strengthened problem-solving skills through JavaScript logic implementation.<br>
    - Learned techniques for managing game state and user interactions.<br>
    - Explored methods to optimize code for improved performance.<br>

 <h1>Understanding Game Functions</h1>

    <h2>startTimer</h2>
    <p>Sets up a game timer using setInterval. It calls updateTimer every second to track game time.</p>

    <h2>updateTimer</h2>
    <p>Tracks time, increments seconds, and updates minutes after every 60 seconds. Displays time on the webpage.</p>

    <h2>stopTimer</h2>
    <p>Halts the game's timer by clearing the interval set by startTimer, stopping time count.</p>

    <h2>toggleSquare</h2>
    <p>Manages square states on the board. Toggles squares' state upon click and affects adjacent squares.</p>

    <h2>checkGameState</h2>
    <p>Checks if the player has won (all squares off) or lost (exceeded max moves). Determines game outcome.</p>

    <h2>displayWin</h2>
    <p>Called when the player wins. It displays a success alert and stops the game timer.</p>

    <h2>displayLoss</h2>
    <p>Invoked when player exceeds allowed moves. It shows a loss alert and stops the timer.</p>

    <h2>newGame</h2>
    <p>Resets the game to its initial state. Clears move count, resets board, and restarts the timer.</p>

    <h2>resetBoard</h2>
    <p>Randomizes the on/off state of each square for a unique game experience at the start.</p>
